#### Known Issues
1. pipenv keeps looking for python 3.13, for the sake of moving foward I will do things globally with pip
   1. It is best to run pip from an admin command prompt (I think) as then it installs under actual python and not roaming app data
   2. ANS: I now just activate venv with the VScode bottom right select interpreter option etc.
